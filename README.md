Contains code for the project described [here](https://immindich.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/09/30/gemma-bilinear.html).

Notes on running the code:
- Based on my own experience, you may need to install pytorch according to the directions on the website before installing the other packages.
- You need log into HuggingFace, accept the license agreement for Gemma and Gemma Scope, and authenticate on your local machine.
- Some of the numbers are hardcoded based on the amount of VRAM I had (80GB). If you had less, you may need to change them.
